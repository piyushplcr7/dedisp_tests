# test\<x\>
Simple test implementation for the dedisp library with different implementations of dedisp plan.
Using fixed settings for the dedisp plan.

Original test application from Paul Ray (2013) with extention and wrappers to use multiple different implementations.

## Usage
- `<x>` can be one of current three implementations for dedispersion: `dedisp`, `tdd` or `fdd`
- Note: runtime of the application is too short for benchmarking of implementation differences, use `bench` applications instead for this purpose

## Example
- `<install dir>/dedisp/bin/testdedisp`
